# Instacart Warehouses
This is a program to analyze the optimal locations for Instacart. The company has the partnership with over 20 high schools in San Fransisco. Use K-means methodology to get the centers of gravity. The results are two optimal warehouse locations.

# Constraint
The center of gravity is therefore the location giving the lowest total transport costs.
